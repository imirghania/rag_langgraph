      "{'generate': {'answer': '<think>\\nOkay, I\\'m trying to figure out how to answer the question \"How to make a withdrawal?\" based on the provided context. \\n\\nFirst, looking at the context, it seems like there\\'s some information about withdrawing money. It mentions that withdrawals aren\\'t cancellable and are automatically processed unless made incorrectly. There are details about the withdrawal period, which is from 15 minutes to 7 days. Also, it talks about why a withdrawal hasn\\'t been credited yet and what steps I can take if that\\'s the case.\\n\\nI notice the context has multiple sections, some repeat similar information. The key points are:\\n1. Withdrawals aren\\'t cancellable.\\n2. They\\'re processed automatically.\\n3. If there was a mistake in making the request, the payment is rejected shortly.\\n4. There\\'s no confirmation until processing is done.\\n5. The withdrawal period is 15 minutes to 7 days, and you don\\'t need to worry about it unless something goes wrong.\\n\\nSince the question is \"How to make a withdrawal?\", I should focus on actionable steps. It seems the context mentions that there\\'s no cancellation option. So maybe the answer is that withdrawals can\\'t be canceled once made, but you have confirmation after processing. \\n\\nI think I can structure this by stating that you cannot cancel a withdrawal request and provide details about how it\\'s processed. Also, include the period length and what happens if it doesn\\'t work out.\\n\\nI need to make sure my answer is concise, within three sentences, and uses the context provided without adding extra info.\\n</think>\\n\\nHow to make a withdrawal:\\n\\n1. Withdrawals cannot be canceled once made.\\n2. Processing a withdrawal is automatic; mistakes are rejected promptly.\\n3. You will receive confirmation after processing and funds appear in your account.\\n\\nAnswer:'}}\n",
