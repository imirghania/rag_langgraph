      "{'generate': {'answer': '<think>\\nOkay, I need to figure out how to answer this question. The user asked, \"How to make a withdrawal?\" and provided several context pieces. Let me read through the context carefully.\\n\\nFirst, it says that withdrawals aren\\'t cancellable on our site. They process automatically but if you made a mistake, the payment is rejected quickly. There\\'s also an explanation about the withdrawal period: 15 minutes to 7 days, you don\\'t need to wait because of safety and security, just know after making a withdrawal it\\'s not recommended to place a bet.\\n\\nThe last part repeats the same points without answering the original question. So, the user is asking for steps on how to make a withdrawal, but the context seems to focus more on automatic processing and why withdrawals can\\'t be canceled or if they\\'re credited.\\n\\nI should probably explain that we don\\'t process cancellations here because of safety, but it\\'s okay to try withdrawing again. Also mention the period before it gets processed.\\n</think>\\n\\nYou cannot cancel a withdrawal request through our platform. Withdrawals are automatically processed, and once you make an error in the request, your payment may be rejected quickly. The withdrawal period is 15 minutes to 7 days; while waiting during this time is fine due to safety and security protocols, it\\'s not recommended to place bets after making a withdrawal. You can try withdrawing again later within the accepted period.'}}\n",
